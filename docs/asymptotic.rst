Asymptotic MK Test
==================

MKado implements the asymptotic MK test from `Messer & Petrov (2013)`_, which corrects for the bias caused by slightly deleterious mutations that inflate polymorphism counts.

Background
----------

The standard MK test assumes that all non-synonymous polymorphisms are either neutral or adaptive. In reality, many non-synonymous polymorphisms are **weakly deleterious** — harmful enough to eventually be removed by selection but not so harmful that they're immediately eliminated.

These weakly deleterious mutations:

- Contribute to Pn (non-synonymous polymorphism)
- Rarely reach fixation, so they don't contribute to Dn
- Inflate the Pn/Dn ratio
- Cause alpha to be **underestimated** (often yielding negative values)

The asymptotic MK test addresses this bias by examining how alpha varies with **derived allele frequency** and extrapolating to high frequencies where deleterious variants have been purged.

The Key Insight
---------------

Weakly deleterious mutations have a characteristic frequency signature:

- **Common at low frequencies**: Selection hasn't had time to remove them
- **Rare at high frequencies**: Selection has purged most of them

By calculating alpha separately at different frequency classes, we can observe this pattern and extrapolate to what alpha would be if all deleterious polymorphisms were removed.

The α(x) Formula
----------------

At each derived allele frequency bin *x*, alpha is calculated as:

.. math::

   \alpha(x) = 1 - \frac{D_s}{D_n} \times \frac{P_n(x)}{P_s(x)}

Where:

- D\ :sub:`n`, D\ :sub:`s` = total nonsynonymous and synonymous divergence
- P\ :sub:`n`\ (x), P\ :sub:`s`\ (x) = nonsynonymous and synonymous polymorphisms in frequency bin *x*

As *x* approaches 1.0, deleterious polymorphisms are increasingly purged, and α(x) converges to the true proportion of adaptive substitutions.

Determining Derived Allele Frequency
------------------------------------

To calculate derived frequency, we need to distinguish **ancestral** (original) from **derived** (new mutation) alleles. MKado uses the outgroup:

1. At each polymorphic codon in the ingroup, identify which alleles are present
2. Compare with the outgroup codon at the same position
3. The allele shared between ingroup and outgroup is **ancestral**
4. **Derived frequency** = 1.0 − frequency(ancestral allele)

**Example:**

If a codon position has allele A at 80% and allele B at 20% in the ingroup, and the outgroup has allele A:

- A is ancestral (shared with outgroup)
- B is derived (new mutation)
- Derived allele frequency = 0.20

.. note::

   Sites where no ingroup allele matches the outgroup cannot be polarized and are excluded from frequency spectrum analysis.

Model Fitting and Selection
---------------------------

MKado fits two candidate models to the α(x) curve:

**Exponential model** (3 parameters):

.. math::

   \alpha(x) = a + b \cdot e^{-c \cdot x}

**Linear model** (2 parameters):

.. math::

   \alpha(x) = a + b \cdot x

The exponential model captures the expected shape when weakly deleterious mutations cause alpha to increase with frequency. The linear model provides a robust fallback when data are sparse or noisy.

**Model selection** follows the `asymptoticMK R package <https://github.com/MesserLab/asymptoticMK>`_ convention (`Haller & Messer 2017`_):

1. If exponential fit produces a confidence interval width > 100, use the **linear model** (exponential is unstable)
2. Otherwise, compare both models using **AIC** (Akaike Information Criterion)
3. Select the model with lower AIC
4. If both fits fail, report the highest-frequency bin's alpha as a fallback

Usage
-----

Single Gene Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   # Basic asymptotic MK test
   mkado test alignment.fa -i ingroup -o outgroup -a

   # With 20 frequency bins (default is 10)
   mkado test alignment.fa -i ingroup -o outgroup -a -b 20

   # Generate alpha(x) plot
   mkado test alignment.fa -i ingroup -o outgroup -a --plot-asymptotic alpha.png

Batch Analysis (Aggregated)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For multi-gene analyses, aggregating data across genes provides more statistical power:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Pool polymorphisms across all genes
   mkado batch alignments/ -i ingroup -o outgroup -a

   # With custom frequency bins and plot
   mkado batch alignments/ -i ingroup -o outgroup -a -b 20 --plot-asymptotic alpha.png

   # Control which frequency bins are used for curve fitting
   mkado batch alignments/ -i ingroup -o outgroup -a --freq-cutoffs 0.15,0.85

Batch Analysis (Per-Gene)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   # Separate asymptotic test for each gene
   mkado batch alignments/ -i ingroup -o outgroup -a --per-gene

Output
------

The asymptotic test reports:

- **alpha_asymptotic**: Extrapolated alpha at derived frequency = 1.0
- **CI_low, CI_high**: 95% bootstrap confidence interval
- **model_type**: Selected model (exponential or linear)
- **a, b, c**: Fitted model parameters (c only for exponential)

Example output (pretty format):

.. code-block:: text

   Asymptotic MK Test Results:
     Divergence:    Dn=18828, Ds=49857
     Polymorphism:  Pn=7843, Ps=25083
     Alpha (asymptotic): 0.5723
     95% CI: [0.4879, 0.6567]
     Model: exponential

The Alpha(x) Plot
-----------------

The ``--plot-asymptotic`` option generates a visualization showing:

- **Scatter points**: Observed α values at each frequency bin
- **Fitted curve**: Exponential or linear fit
- **Horizontal band**: Asymptotic α estimate with 95% CI
- **X-axis**: Derived allele frequency
- **Y-axis**: α(x)

This plot helps assess:

- Whether α(x) increases with frequency (expected pattern)
- The quality of the curve fit
- How much deleterious polymorphism affects lower frequencies

Frequency Cutoffs
-----------------

The ``--freq-cutoffs`` option controls which frequency bins are used for curve fitting:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Fit using bins between 10% and 90% frequency (default)
   mkado batch alignments/ -i sp1 -o sp2 -a --freq-cutoffs 0.1,0.9

   # Stricter cutoffs for noisy data
   mkado batch alignments/ -i sp1 -o sp2 -a --freq-cutoffs 0.2,0.8

This does **not** exclude polymorphisms from the total counts — it only affects which bins inform the curve fit. Extreme frequency bins often have sparse data and can destabilize the fit.

Comparison with Other Methods
-----------------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 20 55

   * - Method
     - Corrects for
     - Best used when
   * - Standard α
     - Nothing
     - Quick assessment; comparing specific genes
   * - α_TG
     - Sample size heterogeneity across genes
     - Multi-gene analysis with minimal deleterious load
   * - **Asymptotic α**
     - Weakly deleterious mutations
     - Most genome-wide analyses (recommended default)

**Typical pattern** across methods:

- Standard α is often **negative** due to excess Pn from deleterious mutations
- α_TG is **less biased** by gene sample size but still affected by deleterious load
- Asymptotic α is typically **higher and positive**, revealing adaptive substitutions

When to Use Asymptotic α
------------------------

**Use asymptotic α when:**

- Analyzing genome-wide or multi-gene data
- Weakly deleterious mutations are a concern (most analyses)
- You need the most accurate estimate of adaptive substitution rate
- You have sufficient polymorphism data (hundreds of segregating sites)

**Consider alternatives when:**

- Analyzing a single gene with few polymorphisms (standard test may be more appropriate)
- Polymorphism data is too sparse for reliable frequency binning
- You specifically want an unbiased multi-gene estimate without frequency modeling (use α_TG)

Interpreting Results
--------------------

- **α ≈ 0**: Little evidence for adaptive evolution; most substitutions are neutral
- **α > 0**: Proportion of substitutions driven by positive selection
- **α < 0**: Unusual; may indicate model misspecification or very strong deleterious load

For typical Drosophila genome-wide analyses, asymptotic α is often 0.4–0.6, indicating that 40–60% of amino acid substitutions were adaptive.
